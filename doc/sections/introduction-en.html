TAV is designed to represent the intricacies of literary annotations. In particular, it seeks to identify, link, and contextually enrich the mentions of tree-like entities in the works of Vladimir Nabokov. It does so by capturing the information about resources that contain the mentions of tree-like entities and puts forward a "match" using the SKOS vocabulary so as to link them to external databases. Other aspects of these tree-mentions including their geographic distribution, allusions to works of art, and other literary associations can also be represented through this vocabulary.</span>
