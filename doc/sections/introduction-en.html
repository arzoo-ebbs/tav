TAV is designed to represent the intricacies of literary annotations. In particular, it seeks to identify, link, and contextually enrich mentions of tree-like entities in the works of Vladimir Nabokov. It captures information about resources containing the entity mentions and uses the SKOS vocabulary to establish matches with external databases. Additionally, it represents aspects such as the geographic distribution, allusions to different works of art, and other literary associations related to the tree-like entities.
